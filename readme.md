### (FCC)_Node.js_Express Course (Building 4 projects)

I've been following [this series of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwfE7fSVaZM) and
so far I'm having a blast (I'm only two projects left to finish the whole video). I just wanted to 
share my advancements and notes. 

_the projects I'm uploading aren't 100% faithful to those in the video_ 

_also, the frontend in the first project isn't mine at all; the instructor of the video prepared it to ease the tutorial a bit_ 

_I might add a few things to the projects that aren't in the tutorial_

1) Task Manager 
    * the project consists in a Task Manager to write down what is it you have to do later
    * the only major change I've done is not to use the cloud but rather a local MongoDB server
    * I've also omitted a few steps that where suggested by John (the instructor) in the last minutes of the first titorial

2) Store API 
    * the project consists in a Store, a web store, in which you can browse a list of products (so far my favourite project)
    * the only major change I've done is not to use the cloud but rather a local MongoDB server
