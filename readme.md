### (FCC)_Node.js_Express Course (Building 4 projects)

I've been following [this series of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwfE7fSVaZM) and
so far I'm having a blast (I'm only one project left to finish the whole video). I just wanted to 
share my advancements and notes. 

_the projects I'm uploading aren't 100% faithful to those in the video_ 

_also, the frontend in the first project isn't mine at all; the instructor of the video prepared it to ease the tutorial a bit_

_again, the frontend of the third project isn't mine at all; it was prepared by the instructor of the video to make things a little faster and easier_

_I might add a few things to the projects that aren't in the tutorial_

1) Task Manager 
    * the project consists in a Task Manager to write down what is it you have to do later
    * the only major change I've done is not to use the cloud but rather a local MongoDB server
    * I've also omitted a few steps that where suggested by John (the instructor) in the last minutes of the first titorial

2) Store API 
    * the project consists in a Store, a web store, in which you can browse a list of products (so far my favourite project)
    * the only major change I've done is not to use the cloud but rather a local MongoDB server

3) JWT Basics 
    * the project consists in a lucky number generator through a login menu that asks for username and password (the project itself does not work with a database)
    * some changes here and there; I added some practices from the previous projects, and skipped some suggestions from the last minutes of this one
    * finally used the .gitignore file
